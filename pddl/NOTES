TYPES:

	validate seems to accept widening conversions (e.g., an
	action parameter can be a narrower type than the parameter of
	a predicate for which it appears as an argument, but not the
	other way around).

	This implies the following test:
		are *all* of the parameter types of an action valid
		types for the predicates for which they are argumets.
